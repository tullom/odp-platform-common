This repository contains a collection of common tools, components, and documentation provided by [Open Device Partnership](https://opendevicepartnership.github.io/documentation/guide/overview.html) and intended to be consumed as a git submodule within a parent platform repository.

## Folder Structure and Content

The top-level directories represent broad segments of a platform such as a firmware stage or a hardware target.

Each segment directory contains one or more module folders that are intended to be stand-alone items with their own infrastructure such as a `README.md` file and build sub-system.  Examples of module usage can be found in one or more of the `odp-platform-*` repositories.
